# Overview

This code builds and evaluates a predictive model for financial forecasting or trading, likely for cryptocurrency prices.
It involves data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.
Key libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, Plotly, and scipy.stats.
# Key Steps

## Importing Libraries:

NumPy, Pandas, Plotly, scipy.stats, TensorFlow, and Keras are imported for data manipulation, visualization, statistical calculations, and machine learning.
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

* Data is loaded from a CSV file containing cryptocurrency price data.
* Timestamps are converted to datetime format.
* Data is filtered for a specific date range.
* Features are created from high, low, close, open, and volume prices.
* Data is normalized using MinMaxScaler.
* Data is reshaped for sequential input to the model.
## Model Building:

* A sequential model is defined using Keras.
* Multiple GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layers are used for sequential prediction.
## Model Compilation:

* The model is compiled with Adam optimizer, mean squared error (MSE) loss, and MSE metric.
* Data is split into training and testing sets.
## Training:

* The model is trained using callbacks for early stopping, model checkpointing, and learning rate scheduling.
## Evaluation:

* Predictions are made on the test set.
* Predictions and actual values are plotted using seaborn.
* Fitness ratio is calculated to assess model performance.
## Out-of-Sample Evaluation:

* Additional data is loaded for out-of-sample evaluation.
* Features are generated similarly to the training data.
* A trading algorithm makes decisions based on predictions, skewness, and standard deviation.
Trading results are analyzed for profitability and compared to buy-and-hold strategy.
Maximum drawdown is also calculated.
